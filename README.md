I appreaciated the opportunity to learn more about DICOM images and how to work with them.

I chose golang because I wanted to get a feel for what it might look like when working with Pockethealth. I have a little hobby experience with golang, no professional experience with golang. I skipped error handling and testing in the interest of speed and reducing complexity. With web servers, you would want to check that each error is semantically accurate and returning the appropriate HTTP status. Thank you for carefully considering my application.
